About
================================================================================
I am  a mobile application developer specializing in iOS development, API design
and implementation. I worked for Whole Foods Market, Inc. for 8 years ending my
career as the lead developer for mobile initiatives. I have developed 
enterprise mobile applicaitons, designed and implemented several API systems, 
and led many mobile and desktop based web development projects as a member of 
a Skunkworks style R&D group within the company. 

Since WFM, I have begun a freelance development career and have cofounded a 
small mobile studio, Moonshine Interactive. In my free time I enjoy supporting
my two boys athletic pursuits, playing music, and fishing.
